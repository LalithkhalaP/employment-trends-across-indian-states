Introduction Analyzing employment data across Indian states is essential for understanding labor market dynamics and supporting SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth. This project uses Python to process and visualize employment rates and workforce sizes, highlighting regional disparities and economic patterns.

Objectives To analyze employment rates and workforce sizes across Indian states To visualize disparities and trends using Python To demonstrate practical use of data science in socio-economic analysis

Software Requirements Language: Python IDE: Visual Studio Code Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Data Structure Used Pandas DataFrame: for tabular data manipulation NumPy arrays: for numerical operations These structures allow efficient sorting, filtering, and statistical analysis.

Functionalities 1.Load and clean employment data 2.Sort states by employment rate and workforce size 3.Identify top and bottom performers 4.Calculate regional disparities 5.Generate six visualizations 6.Save outputs as CSV and PNG

Project Explanation This project is a Python-based employment analysis system. It uses a synthetic dataset of Indian states and visualizes employment trends through six charts. The system highlights top-performing states, workforce distribution, and regional disparities. It demonstrates how data science can support economic planning and policy-making.

Code Explanation The Python code includes: create_sample_data(): Generates synthetic employment data Sorting and Filtering: Identifies top/bottom 5 states Visualization Setup: Uses Matplotlib and Seaborn for styling and plotting Graph Export: Saves all charts as indian_employment_analysis.png The code is modular, readable, and designed for extensibility.

Conclusion This project demonstrates how Python can be used to analyze and visualize employment data, supporting SDG 8. It highlights regional disparities and provides insights for policymakers and researchers.

Future Enhancements Use real-time data from government sources Add interactive dashboards (e.g., Plotly, Dash) Integrate with web applications Include predictive modeling for employment trends
